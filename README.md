# php-books-api

A basic example of retrieving data using the Google Books API and PHP. 

The API endpoints in the example are both public endpoints and do not require an API key. However, if you want to add your API key simply follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) 
2. Create an API key
3. Put your API key into the first line of PHP in the ```maps.php``` file
4. Upload your files to a PHP server and test

## Tutorial Requirements:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/maps)
